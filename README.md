Understanding Grovers Algorithm and implementing an n bit implementation on IBM QASM

The goal of this lab day is understanding [Grovers Algorithm](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/proxy/tutorial/full-user-guide/004-Quantum_Algorithms/070-Grover's_Algorithm.html) and trying to implement an n bit search in Python to create a QASM definition that can be run on IBM's quantum computer (or simulator).

## Requirements

* Basic knowledge of Quantum Mechanics.
* free credentials for [IBM Quantum Experience](https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/)
* knowledge of Python.
